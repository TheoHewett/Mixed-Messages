**A basic program created with Javascript** 

When run, this program will log 3 pessimistic outlooks to the console, generated using the following:

- A random number generator
- An object with multiple keys, each with a value of an array of strings
- A function that iterates through the object and returns the value found at a random index of each array
- A function that formats the returned values to make for more pleasant reading/visuals.
